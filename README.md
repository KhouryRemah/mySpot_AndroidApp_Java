Project in Software: 

design an Android application aimed to help car owners in the Technion campus find the nearest parking lot under time and labels restrictions. 

This application uses an artificial intelligence algorithm to predict the availability of parking lots in any required day and is implemented on Android Studio in java.

I implemented this app with a partner called Elias Abo sinni in 2020 during the course "project in software".
